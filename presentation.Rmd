Non-profit biomedical research institute founded in 2007

<br/>

> We work to redefine how complex biological data is gathered, shared and used, redefining it through open systems, incentives, and norms.

## Our focus

> Engage <span style="color: #177bad">**diverse communities**</span> of researchers around biological and analytical problems too complex for a single institution

<br/>

> Empower <span style="color: #177bad">**citizens**</span> to track their own health and <span style="color: #177bad">**contribute**</span> deep phenotypic data to research topics important to them


## Our work

- **Community Building (in disease research)**
- DREAM Challenges (crowdsourced methods development)
- Mobile Health (development for personal medicine)

> All of these involve software and people development.

## DREAM Challenges

- Digital Mammography
- Resilience Project
- Infectious Diseases

Put logos of some challenges here

## Mobile Health

Apple ResearchKit, Android Research Stack, mPower, Parkinson's, Molemapper

## Governance
<br/>

> Data is a gift, which requires **informed consent**.

## Projects

> A collaborative and sharable workspace for organization and description of data and analysis.

## Files

> Scalable, federated cloud storage for any data files

## Organization

> Folders

> Annotations

## Access control

> Team and user-based sharing

> Access restrictions (data use agreements)

## Provenance

> What data or code was used to create something?
## Visualization

## Structured data

> Tabular data files (spreadsheets)
