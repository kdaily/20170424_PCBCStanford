Non-profit biomedical research institute founded in 2007

<br/>

> We work to redefine how complex biological data is gathered, shared and used, redefining it through open systems, incentives, and norms.

## Our focus

> Engage <span style="color: #177bad">**diverse communities**</span> of researchers around biological and analytical problems too complex for a single institution

<br/>

> Empower <span style="color: #177bad">**citizens**</span> to track their own health and <span style="color: #177bad">**contribute**</span> deep phenotypic data to research topics important to them


## Our work

- Community Building (in disease research)
- DREAM Challenges (crowdsourced methods development)
- Mobile Health (app and process development for personal medicine)

## ![synapse](img/newsynapse.png)

> A platform for supporting scientific collaborations centered around shared biomedical data sets with a goal of making biomedical research more transparent, more reproducible, and more accessible to a broader audience of scientists.

## Cloud-enabled collaboration {data-transition="fade"}
